Omalicah'm,

You're the most amazing human being I ever met, by a very long shot.
Thank you for everything you've done for me. All the gifts, the sacrifices.

I love you with everything in me. A year gone, and I only love you much more.

You love people purely. When I talk to you, I can tell that you geniunely care. 
Always there for your everyone. You're rare. Don't change.

I suck at these write-ups, I know. I wish I didn't, so you could actually see what's going on
in my head right now. Anyways, I'll continue to show you how much you mean to me, every day, 
in any way I can. After all, actions speak louder. :)

The world is lucky to have you. Your family is lucky to have you. I'm lucky to have you. Your friends
are lucky to have you.
You're a blessing. A bountiful one, to anyone you come across.

You will conquer all your challenges. In due time. I can't wait to celebrate with you.
Enjoy your day BB. I wish I was there. Hopefully, next year I will be.

Happy Birthday, Omalicha'm.
